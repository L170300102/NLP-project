# NLP-project

I use an IPython notebook with instructions and some code prepared.

- I use Python 3 and Tensorflow 1.0. And it work with many libraries, e.g. NLTK, Scikit-learn, Gensim, Tensorflow, etc.

## Use Google Colab

Use Google Colab where you can install or import all necessary libraries. Instructions on how to run code on Colab are provided in [Here](https://github.com/hse-aml/natural-language-processing, "Class GitHub repository").
